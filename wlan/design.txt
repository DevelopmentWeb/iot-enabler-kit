Rx path

Interrupt for a byte and then go to polling to read remaining bytes 

SLEEP
DISCONNECT
SOCK_CLOSE
Process in the interrupt context
And set the event type
Check if we can receive bytes in interrupt context, interrupt disabled
Better check with a uC

Think of how to give resp and recv data to the application
It is better to process everything in the interrupt context only, I think.

READ DATA 
OK
ERROR

Interrupt
Polling
Read
process
Receiving the response / data from the application


Tx path

First go with sending with out the interrupt.
